JavaScript is dynamically typed. Therefore, programs written in JavaScript do not know the data type of a variable until that variable is assigned a value at runtime. The variable can be reassigned into a value of a different type with no issues or warning. This can result in bugs that are often overlooked, especially in large applications.
TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It was first made public in October 2012 (at version 0.8).
It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and it adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.
It can be easily installed by just a few commands and detailed documentation is available on official website https://www.typescriptlang.org/.
Letâ€™s take a look how it works.
